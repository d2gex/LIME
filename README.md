# LIME

The length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME) model uses length data and biological information to estimate stock status. Key attributes of LIME include: 
- Accounting for time-varying fishing mortality and recruitment
- Requirement of at least 1 year of length composition data of the catch, and assumptions about growth, natural mortality, and maturity
- Estimation of annual fishing mortality, length at 50% and 95% selectivity, and recruitment variation
- Derivation of random effects for time-varying recruitment
- Fitting to multiple years of length composition data and/or catch and/or an abundance index time series, if available.
- Estimation of spawning potential ratio reference points (and MSY-based reference points if there is information on scale, e.g. catch data)

### Upgrades:
This version of LIME modifies the data simulation function and additionally provides the estimated unfished population as N_at0. Such matrix
is already calculated by LIME, however it was left out of the object that `sim_pop` function returned.
